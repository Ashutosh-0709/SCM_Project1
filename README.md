## Premise

In this project, I have leveraged R (RStudio) and linear programming techniques to optimize a supply chain network involving 2 factories, 4 distribution centers, and 6 customers. The objective was to minimize transportation costs while ensuring that supply chain constraints, such as factory capacities, distribution center throughput limits and customer demands, were met efficiently. Through this optimization, the project aimed to enhance overall supply chain performance and improve the alignment between supply and demand.
